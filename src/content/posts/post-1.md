## Howdy!

I've always been eager to share my experience with other people.

This website finally gives me a dedicated place to do so. It is built with
[Astro](https://astro.build/) and uses [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) for the
interactive bits. Everything is served directly from
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), so the entire source code is
available for you to explore.

Here I plan to document my pet projects, experiments and thoughts on web
development. The site itself is a small showcase of what Astro can do: it uses
internationalisation support, light and dark themes and a responsive layout.

Feel free to poke around, read the code and let me know what you think.
